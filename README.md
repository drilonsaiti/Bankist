# Bankist
All of these have been worked on by me:
- Slides
- Opening and closing of modals
- Scrolling to elements
- Hover effects on navigation buttons
- Sticky navigation
- Revealing sections with observer
- Lazy loading of images with observer
- Login functionality
- Transfer amount
- Loan amount
- Sorting
- Timer
- Interval

Please note that the CSS part was not worked on by me, but by Jonas Schmedtmann.
